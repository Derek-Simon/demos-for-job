# demos for a job
 Here are some demos for learning and also for preparing for job interviews.

 I was familiar with many computer techniques before I become a project manager.

 Later, maybe 3 years being a manager, I found I almost forget all the coding abilities except some impressive labels or names of certain technologies.

 And it's being a problem when I wanna go world wild in the Computer Industry, ie: Europe, North America.

 What remains lucky is that I still keep the `Handbook` library which records all the notes and quick tips of my coding jobs.

So, HERE it stores all the demos during my rebuild of coding ability.
